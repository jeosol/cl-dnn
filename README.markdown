# Cl-DNN - Implementation of Deep Neural Networks using Common Lisp

In this project, I implement neural networks using the Common Lisp Programming Language from scratch. Additionally, I have written by from scratch, simple, unoptimized matrix and vector operations related to implementing neural networks. ***SO THIS CODE HAS NOT BEEN OPTIMIZED FOR EFFICIENCY***

Additionally, this is not meant to compete with or replace related Python and deep learning libraries (Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc) that are more advanced that what is implemented here. 

My goal is to implement simple only **sequential** neural network architectures with two specific cases
* One hidden layer (current development)
* Variable hidden layer (next)

Additionally, I plan to apply them to simple image classification tasks.

## Usage
** this library is still in development and being tested
