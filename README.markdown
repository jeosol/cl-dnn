# Cl-DNN - Implementation of Deep Neural Networks using Common Lisp

In this project, I implement neural networks using the Common Lisp Programming Language. This is not meant to compete with related Python and deep learning libraries.

Additionally, I have written by from scratch, simple, unoptimizedmatrix and vector operations related to implementing neural networks.

My goal is to implement only sequential neural network architectures with two specific cases
* One hidden layer (current development)
* Variable hidden layer (next)
